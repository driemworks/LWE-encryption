# Simple Lattice-Based Encryption

This is an implementation of the lattice-based encryption scheme as proposed by [regev (2009)](https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/papers/qcrypto.pdf).

Specifically, this implementation is lifted from chapter 1.3 of [A Tutorial Introduction to Lattice Based Cryptography and Homomorphic Encryption](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08125.pdf)
